# University project "Parceptorn for the calculation of XOR data" 

Requirements for the Matrix class:
1) Creation of matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication.
2) Relize the activation function (sigmoid function).

      $sigm = 1 /(1 + exp^{-x})$

Requirements for NeuralNetwork class:
1) Function "predict" to perform direct propagation. 
2) Function "train" to realize the back propagation algorithm
3) The "fit" function to iterate over the number of given epochs.
